<p>Out of the night that covers me,<br>   
Black as the Pit from pole to pole, <br>   
I thank whatever gods may be <br>   
For my unconquerable soul.<br> </p>  
<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance <br> 
I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br>   
Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>   
My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>   </p> 
<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>   
Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>  
And yet the menace of the years <br>   
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br>  </p> 
<p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br>    
How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>    
I am the master of my fate:<br> 
I am the captain of my soul<br> </p>
